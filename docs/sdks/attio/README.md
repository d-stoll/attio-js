# Attio SDK

## Overview

Attio API: Attio is a CRM platform which is highly customisable, incredibly powerful and data-driven. The public API allows you to manipulate records, lists, notes, tasks and more. You can find more information about the Attio API in the [official docs](https://docs.attio.com/docs/overview). Unfortunately, an official JavaScript or TypeScript SDK has not been released yet. In the meantime, we maintain this unofficial SDK to bridge the gap until an official SDK becomes available.
